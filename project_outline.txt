Architecture
 - server is master
 - nodes have fail-safe states
 - nodes are all controlled by master
 - nodes will go to fail-safe state after comms inactivity of 10 minutes
 - nodes only do things when told to by master
 - master must continually update nodes (so they don't go to fail-safe state)

Tank Controller Node
 - Node addresses 0b01xx xxxx
 - sense water level
 - sense full/overflow/empty/critically_empty switches (do we need all those?)
 - turn on/off fill valves
 - turn on/off sprinkler pump
 - sprinkler pump current sense (ACS730)
 - fill valve current sense (ACS711)

valve controller node
 - node addresses 0b10xx xxxx
 - turn on/off valve
 - valve current sense (ACS711)
 - temp sense

master node (server?)
 - node address 0b0000 0001


Tank Controller
 - Pressure based water level sensor (should there be one in each tank?)
 - overflow float switch (should there be a redundant one? one in each tank?)
 - empty float switch?
 - turn on/off fill valve
 - sense current of valve
 - Sprinkler pump turn on/off
 - sense current of sprinkler pump relay
 - sense current of sprinkler pump itself?
 - settings
   - address
   - tank turn on level
   - tank turn off level
   - action timeout
     - Some actions time out and revert to a safe mode (ie. )
   
valve controller
 - turn on/off valve
 - sense current of valve (to make sure it's on, and not shorted)
 - sense temperature

Comms protocol
 - need to incorporate a method of addressing controllers (tank or valve)
   - change the type byte for an address byte in header
   - Add type byte into the payload
   - Add a sender address byte to header for responses

Comms PHY
 - what baud rate?
 - use oscillator in pic to do OOK over an ac coupled line?
   - Do I need an amplifier for this?
 

Thresholds
 1 open fill valve water level threshold (when sprinkler pump not on) (half full)
 2 close fill valve water level threshold (when sprinkler pump not on) (near full)
 3 turn off sprinkler pump water level threshold (near empty)
 4 turn on sprinkler pump water level threshold (near full)
 5 overflow (overflow float switch)
 6 underflow (empty float switch)

Logic for filling tanks no pump
 - when level gets down to turn on threshold 1
 - open fill valves
 - wait until threshold 2 (from pressure sensor) crosses threshold in settings
 - should there be a timeout? ie. 6 hours?
 - close valves
 
Logic for watering
 - if water level below overflow, turn on filling
 - If water level above threshold 3 when watering commences, turn on sprinkler pump
   - Maybe leave this out, so tanks fill, and then sprinkler pump turns on?
 - when water level gets below threshold 3, turn off pump
 - when water level gets above threshold 4, turn on pump
   - Should there be a fill pump rest period in here? (maybe 1 hour)
 - if water level goes above overflow while sprinkler pump on, shut off pump and filling, and raise alert (something is broken)

Setup option 1
 - tank controller is just another peripheral on the bus.
   - This allows for two tank controllers for level sensing, valve on sensing, etc
 - main controller (or server) talks to the tank controller and all valve controllers
 - keep-alive signal from main controller to each other controller to make sure things are working
 - server keeps track of watering time
 
Setup option 2
 - tank controller is what talks to all the valve controllers
 - server tells tank controller what to do and when (ie turn on station 1 and 2, turn off all)
 - server keeps track of watering time
 - server polls for when watering pump is on or not (to keep track of actual watering time)
 - keep-alive signals to make sure everything is working

Setup option 3
 - Tank controller is what talks to all the valve controllers
 - server transmits schedule to tank controller
 - tank controller keeps track of time and turns things on or off
