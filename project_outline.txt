Sensors
 - Pressure based water level sensor (should there be one in each tank?)
 - overflow float switch (should there be a redundant one? one in each tank?)
 - empty float switch?

Thresholds
 1 open fill valve water level threshold (when sprinkler pump not on) (half full)
 2 close fill valve water level threshold (when sprinkler pump not on) (near full)
 3 turn off sprinkler pump water level threshold (near empty)
 4 turn on sprinkler pump water level threshold (near full)
 5 overflow (overflow float switch)
 6 underflow (empty float switch)

Logic for filling tanks no pump
 - when level gets down to turn on threshold 1
 - open fill valves
 - wait until threshold 2 (from pressure sensor) crosses threshold in settings
 - should there be a timeout? ie. 6 hours?
 - close valves
 
Logic for watering
 - if water level below overflow, turn on filling
 - If water level above threshold 3 when watering commences, turn on sprinkler pump
   - Maybe leave this out, so tanks fill, and then sprinkler pump turns on?
 - when water level gets below threshold 3, turn off pump
 - when water level gets above threshold 4, turn on pump
   - Should there be a fill pump rest period in here? (maybe 1 hour)
 - if water level goes above overflow while sprinkler pump on, shut off pump and filling, and raise alert (something is broken)
